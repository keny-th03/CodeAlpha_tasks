📉 Unemployment Analysis in India 📉

This project analyzes unemployment trends in India, with a special focus on the impact of COVID-19. It uses Python for data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory analysis, and is built to be interactive with Streamlit.

📝 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
- Explore unemployment rate data representing the percentage of unemployed people.
- Analyze trends over time and identify seasonal patterns.
- Investigate the effect of COVID-19 on unemployment rates.
- Present insights that could inform economic or social policies.

📊 Features
- Region-wise Analysis: Compare unemployment rates across different regions of India.
- Trend Visualization: Line plots showing unemployment over time.
- COVID-19 Impact: Highlight changes before and after the pandemic.
- Seasonal Trends: Identify monthly/seasonal fluctuations in unemployment.
- Heatmaps & Pie Charts: Summarize data visually for easier understanding.
- Interactive Streamlit Dashboard: Users can interact with visualizations in a web app.

🛠 Technologies Used
- Python: Core programming language
- Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and cleaning
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization
- Streamlit: Interactive web app
- Jupyter/VS Code: Development environment

📂 Dataset
Two datasets were used in this analysis:
- Unemployment in India.csv – general unemployment rates by region and date
- Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv – detailed dataset for COVID-19 period
Both datasets include columns like:
- Date
- Region
- Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)

🚀 How to Run
1. Install required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py

3. Explore interactive visualizations in your browser.

📈 Example Visualizations
- Line Plot: Region-wise unemployment trends
- Pie Chart: Average unemployment before vs. after COVID-19
- Heatmap: Region-wise unemployment comparison
- Seasonal Trends: Month-wise variations in unemployment

🔑 Key Patterns Identified
- Unemployment sharply increased during COVID‑19 lockdown period
- Strong seasonal variation exists
- Regional disparities in unemployment rates
- Post‑COVID gradual recovery observed

📌 Policy-Relevant Insights
- Government should promote job creation programs during crisis periods
- Focus on region-specific employment policies
- Encourage skill development for seasonal workers
- Strengthen social security systems during economic shocks

🏁 Conclusion
This analysis shows how unemployment trends changed over time in India, especially during COVID-19. Python-based data analysis and visualization help policymakers understand labor market dynamics and plan effective interventions.
